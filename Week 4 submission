File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.

def read_and_write_files(input_filename, output_filename):
    try:
        with open(input_filename, "r") as infile:
            content = infile.read()

        modified_content = content.upper()

        with open(output_filename, "w") as outfile:
            outfile.write(modified_content)

        print(f"File '{output_filename}' has been successfully created with modified content.")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{input_filename}' does not exist.")
    except IOError:
        print(f"Error: Unable to read/write to the file.")
        


Error Handling Lab üß™: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn‚Äôt exist or can‚Äôt be read.

def handle_file_error():
    filename = input("Please enter the filename: ")

    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as file:
            content = file.read()
            print("File content successfully read:")
            print(content)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
    except IOError:
        print(f"Error: There was a problem reading the file '{filename}'.")
